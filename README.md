# ENGL105-Unit3
This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample data sets for Prof. Gotzler's fall sections of ENGL105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains two CSV files, compiled of the [original County Health data](/datasets/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) and its [coinciding NC subset](/datasets/NC_subset.csv). The datasets are contained in the **datasets folder** above, and below them is the [Markdown directory](/MarkdownDirectory.ipynb) that contains the step-by-step instructions on creating the new subset in JupyterLab

The data comes from the [UNC Davis Library public repository](https://library.unc.edu/davis/) and is identified as the "County Health Public Dataset" 



### What is the function of the NC Subset?
The NC_subset data we created can be used to identify the various health conditions across the state of North Carolina. Specifically, locating the average number of teen births throughout different counties and visualizing trends and common correlations. As seen in the map below, by comparing the data across the counties it becomes clear the areas with the highest number of teen births. We can use this to compare with other factors across counties including the poverty rate to see if there is any correlation. 

### Context
It is important to analyze teen pregnancy across the state to understand the other factors that effect the livelihood of teens. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Importance%20of%20Prevention&text=The%20children%20of%20teenage%20mothers,unemployment%20as%20a%20young%20adult), it is known that most teen moms drop out of highschool and only about 50% get a diploma. After school it is even less likely that they will become employed, supporting that teen births affect many different standards of life as seen in the NC and across various counties.

### Who can the data be useful for and why? 
This repository was created to assist the public in creating a subset from a large data set, specifically breaking down the public health data found in UNC Davis Library's public repository. This data can be useful for hospital workers and social workers because their jobs are directly related to teen births and they witness the effects throughout the community. 


**What is the correlation between average teen births and NC counties?**

*The column chart was created with Tablaeu and visualizes a random sample of 10 counties in North Carolina and their average number of teen births.*
